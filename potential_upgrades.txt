Stochastic Control Approach
Make sure the pair holds one by checking if there are any ruptures in the beta between the stocks
Make the strategy regime adaptive, not enter at the same level for different volatility regimes
Volatility scaled allocation, allocate less to volatile spreads
Add transaction costs
Don't allow negative equity in a pair, shut it down if I lose all the capital
Better assess performance by obviously seperating the data used to select pairs and the one used for backtest
